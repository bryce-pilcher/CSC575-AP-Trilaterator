# CSC575Project
The goal of this project is to write a software capable to localize the access points and yourself in a building. This program can be writing in any languages which you feels comfortable with, and can be developed either on laptop (Linux or Windows), or smart phones (Android). This project has two phases. For the first phase, you will develop the program which is able to locate the position of an AP based on received RSSI. Your program shall at least have indicators reflect the signal strength, and possible directions. As you moving inside the building and collect enough RSSI samples, it will eventually lead you to the correct position. For the second phase, assume that the AP positions and names are known (which can be collected from phase 1), given the map of the building, your program shall indicate your location with reasonable accuracy. Final experiments and demos should be conducted in EBII, while you are free to use your own devices for development.
